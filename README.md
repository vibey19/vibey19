## Hola!!

I’m a AI/ML Developer / Web developer with a focus on writing clean, efficient, and maintainable code. I enjoy solving complex problems, breaking them down into simple solutions, and building projects that actually make an impact.

💻 Core focus: AI/ML Algorithms and Web development with attention to detail and usability.

🎧 Lifelong learner: I keep up with the latest in tech through podcasts and articles.

✍️ Creative outlet: Poetry helps me balance logic with creativity.

📚 Beyond code: A fan of crime and thriller novels — I love chasing patterns and unexpected twists.

Here on GitHub, you’ll find a mix of projects, experiments, and contributions that reflect my journey as a developer.
