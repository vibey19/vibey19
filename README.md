## Hola!!

I'm the maestro behind the screen, turning coffee into code and chasing bugs like they owe me money. Here's a glimpse into my binary-fueled existence:

## About Me 👾🧥
🚀 I'm not just your typical web developer; I'm a code conjurer ( I think it sounds cool! ) . When I'm not in front of the screen, you'll probably find me lost in the fascinating world of tech podcasts.

✨ Away from code, you'll catch me in a poetic trance, weaving words into verses. 📚 I'm also hooked on crime and thriller books, where each page unfolds like a suspenseful script. 🔍
